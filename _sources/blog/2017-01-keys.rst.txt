Linux Quick Tip: Adding GitHub Keys as Authorized Keys
======================================================

Introduction
------------

As a software developer, I constantly work with a bunch of virtual
environments used for testing.

The first step I do â€”Switch from password ssh authorization to
authorization by public key. Let me share with you a handy batch that
will add all of your GitHub keys as authorized keys.

Batch
~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    USERNAME=yourgithubusername

    mkdir -p ~/.ssh

    if ! [[ -f ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ]]; then
      echo "Creating new ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
      touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    fi

    keys=`curl https://api.github.com/users/$USERNAME/keys | grep -o -E "ssh-\w+\s+[^\"]+"`

    for key in $keys; do
      echo $key
      grep -q "$key" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys || echo "$key" &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    done

Usage
-----

Usually I run it as

.. code:: bash

    curl -L http://bit.ly/easytoremembershortcut | bash -s

This approach has already saved me a lot of time!
