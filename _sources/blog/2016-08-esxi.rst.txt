Enable virtualization inside ESXi virtual machine
=================================================

Introduction
------------

One day I got a task to implement a Vagrant-based scenario for my
client. For quite a long time, I've been using free VMWare ESX-i
hypervisor for my experiments, as it allows up to 4 virtual boxes to be
run in parallel for my labs experience.

The first issue I spotted, once I installed Oracle Virtual Box & Vagrant
on my ESXi box, is its inability to start a Vagrant-controlled image due
to the lack of virtualization support. There were no options to turn it
on via the ESXi GUI client, so I have started to look for a solution

Enabling the ssh access on your ESXi host
-----------------------------------------

Please follow the steps below in succession:

a) Start the vSphere client

b) Select ESXi's host configuration tab

c) Select security profile from the list on a left

d) Click properties on the upper right corner, and you will get the a
   popup with all the services on this ESXi box. Select the SSH service
   and press the Options button.

e) Start the SSH service - you are now prepared for the most important
   step

Enabling VT-x / AMD-V virtualization inside ESXi virtual machine
----------------------------------------------------------------

The most tricky part. Make sure to check your steps

a) Shutdown your virtual machine inside ESXi

b) SSH to your ESXi:

.. code:: bash

    ssh -lroot your.esxi.box.address

c) Run df - to locate the address of your mounted drive with VMs

.. code:: bash

     df
    Filesystem        Bytes         Used    Available Use% Mounted on
    VMFS-5     999922073600 539996717056 459925356544  54% /vmfs/volumes/WDC1TB

d) Locate the location of your's vmx

.. code:: bash

    find / -name *.vmx | grep HUM
    /vmfs/volumes/54183927-04f91918-a72a-6805ca147c55/W-NodeBox-HUM/W-NodeBox-HUM.vmx

e) Put ``setting vhv.enable=TRUE`` at the bottom of your box's vmx file

.. code:: bash

     echo 'vhv.enable = "TRUE"' >> /vmfs/volumes/54183927-04f91918-a72a-6805ca147c55/W-NodeBox-HUM/
    W-NodeBox-HUM.vmx

You are done! Start your machine normally and enjoy the possibility to
run vagrant&virtual-box controlled boxes inside your ESXi host.
(Hopefully you need it as me just to test the vagrant setup)

Points of Interest
------------------

This tip allows you to enable virtualization inside nested virtual
machines under ESXi hypervisor.
