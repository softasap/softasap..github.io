Using ansible-container to build your next application base image
=================================================================

Most Dockerfiles start from a parent image. Application baseimage is a
special `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`__ image that is configured for
correct use within Docker containers and aware about your application
requirements, expectations + set of additional tools.

Usually those include, but not limited to:

-  Modifications for Docker-friendliness.
-  Application specific libraries and frameworks
-  Some administration tools, that are especially useful for
   troubleshouting inside docker
-  Mechanisms for easily running multiple processes, without violating
   the Docker philosophy

Perhaps every company or agency dealing with dockerized applications
have or implemented such one. Until now you could find it in a form of
complex shell and makefiles, especially if baseimage is released for
multiple OS-es.

The closer ``ansible-container`` 1.0.0 release is, the more chances that
you would give a try to ansible to take care of your next dockerized
application base image.

Let’s briefly dive into tools and components you might need to do so.

Image building boilerplate with ansible-container
-------------------------------------------------

Folders and files organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can launch building process using any tool you like. From my
experience - I've come so far with the following approach:
https://github.com/Voronenko/container-image-boilerplate

``requirements.txt`` - defines any specific py tools & libs you want to
use together with ansible-container. ``.projmodules`` - list of
dependencies (roles, deployables, etc) needed to compile base image.
Format similar to gitmodules, but without direct links to commit.
Example:

::


    [submodule "roles/sa-nginx-container"]
            path = roles/softasap.sa-nginx-container
            url = https://github.com/softasap/sa-nginx-container.git
    [submodule "roles/sa-uwsgi-container"]
            path = roles/softasap.sa-uwsgi-container
            url = https://github.com/softasap/sa-uwsgi-container.git
    [submodule "roles/sa-include"]
            path = roles/softasap.sa-include
            url = https://github.com/softasap/sa-include.git
    [submodule "deployables/application"]
            path = deployables/application
            url = https://github.com/voronenko-p/django-sample.git

``init.sh`` && ``init_quick.sh`` - resolve external dependencies under
specified locations (roles under roles, deployables under deployables,
etc)

``ansible.cfg`` - by default empty, but you can adjust parameters for
your build process according to documentation.

``version.txt`` - information file gitflow based releasing (x.y.z)

``image.txt`` - additional information about image constructed for
tagging and pushing parts.

``Makefile`` && ``docker-helper.sh`` - orchestration utilities,
discussed in the next chapter.

``docker-compose.yml`` - usually I also provide docker-compose
configuration, so the image can be immediately tried.

``container.yml`` - definition of the image you are going to build

And, of course, ``.gitignore`` - we definitely do not want to commit
external resources. ``p-env`` - virtual environment created during the
build, ``ansible-deployment`` - transient output produced by
ansible-container itself.

::

    roles/*
    ansible-deployment/*
    p-env/*
    deployables/*
    *.retry

Build process orchestration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Makefile implement following phases: ``initialize``

clean
^^^^^

Resets project to initial state by removing all build directories and
artifacts

::

    clean:
            @rm -rf .Python p-env roles ansible-deployment

Initialize
^^^^^^^^^^

Parses .projmodules and checks out necessary roles and deployables

::

    initialize:
            @init_quick.sh

p-env/bin/ansible-container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Internal task - creates and initializes virtual environment with
ansible-container under p-env/ directory.

::

    p-env/bin/ansible-container: p-env/bin/pip
            @touch $@

    p-env/bin/pip: p-env/bin/python
            p-env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

    p-env/bin/python:
            virtualenv -p $(python) --no-site-packages p-env
            @touch $@

build
^^^^^

Executes ansible-container for container.yml, providing path to roles.
Project name influences how produced image will be named.

::

    build:  p-env/bin/ansible-container
            @p-env/bin/ansible-container --debug --project-name $(ROLE_NAME) build --roles-path ./roles/ -- -vvv
            @echo "Application docker image was build"

run and stop
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Potentially, ansible-container allows immediatelly to run and stop
images in a way like docker-compose does. From my experience, that is
not always working, + container.yml is based on 2nd version of the
docker-compose spec, while I usually need at least 3.1 in production.
Anyway steps are provided - they might work in your case. I usually end
with the separate docker-compose.yml v3.1+ in the directory.

::

    run:  p-env/bin/ansible-container
            @echo p-env/bin/ansible-container --debug --project-name $(ROLE_NAME) run --roles-path ./roles/ -- -vvv
            @p-env/bin/ansible-container --debug --project-name $(ROLE_NAME) run --roles-path ./roles/ -- -vvv
            @echo "Application environment was started"

    stop:   p-env/bin/ansible-container
            @echo p-env/bin/ansible-container --debug --project-name $(ROLE_NAME) stop
            @p-env/bin/ansible-container --debug --project-name $(ROLE_NAME) stop
            @echo "Application environment was stopped"

tag and push
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Usually as a result of successful build, you want to push artifact to
some registry. This highly depends on your project, and you most likely
adjust it for your needs.

Providing example: properly tags api and nginx images built and pushes
them to docker hub.

::

    tag:
            @docker tag $(ROLE_NAME)-api:latest softasap/sa-container-box-examples:$(ROLE_NAME).api.$(ROLE_VERSION)
            @docker tag $(ROLE_NAME)-api:latest softasap/sa-container-box-examples:$(ROLE_NAME).api.latest
            @docker tag $(ROLE_NAME)-nginx:latest softasap/sa-container-box-examples:$(ROLE_NAME).nginx.$(ROLE_VERSION)
            @docker tag $(ROLE_NAME)-nginx:latest softasap/sa-container-box-examples:$(ROLE_NAME).nginx.latest

    push:
            @docker push softasap/sa-container-box-examples:$(ROLE_NAME).api.$(ROLE_VERSION)
            @docker push softasap/sa-container-box-examples:$(ROLE_NAME).api.latest
            @docker push softasap/sa-container-box-examples:$(ROLE_NAME).nginx.$(ROLE_VERSION)
            @docker push softasap/sa-container-box-examples:$(ROLE_NAME).nginx.latest

compose helpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Launching, stoppling and dismounting docker-compose managed containers.

::

    compose-up:
            @docker-compose up --no-recreate

    compose-stop:
            @docker-compose stop

    compose-down: compose-stop
            @docker-compose rm --force

That's all. Back to primary target.

Building base image with ansible container.
===========================================

| For base image, I usually want: \* agreed folder organization (I do
  not want to guess each time where and how I need to put logic to run),
  \* robust init system.
| \* optional support for running multiple processes per container (as
  long as container remains single logical unit - it does not contradict
  with Docker philosophy). \* Depending on project I want to be able to
  use different base images and do not want to dive into compilation
  specifics each time. \* Possibility to run logic under custom users
  inside container and synchronize, if necessary files and folders with
  host system.

And final point: as long as possible I want to keep my code organized
better, than series of bash command that usually are hard to read and
hard to adjust in a way we usually do with programs. And this is where
``ansible-container`` will help.

Why valid init for containers is important
------------------------------------------

Although people say, that proper docker microservice should run single
dedicated process, it is not always achievable in real world. More
correct to say, that Docker suggests the philosophy of running a single
logical service per container. A logical service can consist of multiple
OS processes. Sometimes you really need to run more than one service in
a docker container. This is especially true, if you are adapting some
application that previously was running in standalone vps environment.

Why init process is important: running processes can be visualized are
ordered in a tree: each process can spawn child processes, and each
process has a parent except for the top-most process. This top-most
process is the init process. It is started when you start your container
and always has PID 1. This init process is responsible for starting the
rest of the system, including starting your application. When some
process terminates, it turns into smth referred as "defunct process",
also known as a "zombie process"
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie\_process). In simple words, these
are ones that are terminated but have not (yet) been waited for by their
parent processes.

But what if parent process terminates (intentionally, or
unintentionally)? What happens then to its spawned processes? They no
longer have a parent process, so they become "orphaned"
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan\_process).

And this is where the init process kicks in. It becomes new parent
(adopts) orphaned child processes, even though they were never created
directly by the init process. The operating system kernel automatically
handles adoption. Moreover: the operating system expects the init
process to reap adopted children too.

What if not? As long as a zombie is not removed from the system via a
wait, it will consume a slot in the kernel process table, and if this
table fills, it will not be possible to create further processes in the
host system itself. Also, init system implemented wrong often leads to
incorrect handling of processes and signals, and can result in problems
such as containers which can't be gracefully stopped, or leaking
containers which should have been destroyed.

Upstart, Systemd, SysV usually are too heavy (overkill) to be used
inside docker (+ not always easily possible). What are the options ?

Candidates for container init process
-------------------------------------

At a time of article writing, most often used init approaches were:

Custom written init script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

as per docker documentation,
https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/multi-service\_container/ Take a
look on a Proof-of-concept example of such script below

::

    #!/bin/bash

    # Start the first process
    ./my_first_process -D
    status=$?
    if [ $status -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Failed to start my_first_process: $status"
      exit $status
    fi

    # Start the second process
    ./my_second_process -D
    status=$?
    if [ $status -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Failed to start my_second_process: $status"
      exit $status
    fi

    # Naive check runs checks once a minute to see if either of the processes exited.
    # This illustrates part of the heavy lifting you need to do if you want to run
    # more than one service in a container. The container will exit with an error
    # if it detects that either of the processes has exited.
    # Otherwise it will loop forever, waking up every 60 seconds

    while /bin/true; do
      ps aux |grep my_first_process |grep -q -v grep
      PROCESS_1_STATUS=$?
      ps aux |grep my_second_process |grep -q -v grep
      PROCESS_2_STATUS=$?
      # If the greps above find anything, they will exit with 0 status
      # If they are not both 0, then something is wrong
      if [ $PROCESS_1_STATUS -ne 0 -o $PROCESS_2_STATUS -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "One of the processes has already exited."
        exit -1
      fi
      sleep 60
    done

Will work, but really does not guarantee reaping... Let's examine more
robust alternatives.

Dumb-init
~~~~~~~~~

dumb-init is a simple process supervisor and init system designed to run
as PID 1 inside minimal container environments (such as Docker). It is
deployed as a small, statically-linked binary written in C.

dumb-init enables you to simply prefix your command with dumb-init. It
acts as PID 1 and immediately spawns your command as a child process,
taking care to properly handle and forward signals as they are received.

Project repo: https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init

Tini
~~~~

Tini advertises itself as a tiny but valid init for containers.
Promises: \* protection from software that accidentally creates zombie
processes \* ensures the default signal handlers work for the software
you run in your Docker image. \* easy to inject: Docker images that work
without Tini will work with Tini without any changes.

Shipped as precompiled binary for hugh variety of platforms.

Project repo: https://github.com/krallin/tini

Runit
~~~~~

Runit is a cross-platform Unix init scheme with service supervision, a
replacement for sysvinit, and other init schemes. It runs on GNU/Linux,
BSD, can easily be adapted to other Unix operating systems. The program
runit is intended to run as Unix process no 1, it is automatically
started by the runit-init /sbin/init-replacement if this is started by
the kernel.

Project website: http://smarden.org/runit/

S6
~~

S6 is project, actually sibling of the RUnit by
http://skarnet.org/software/s6/overview.html. S6 contains collection of
utilities revolving around process supervision and management, logging,
and system initialization. More over, specifically for a docker exists
helper project, so-called "s6-overlay"
https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay

S6 provides: \* lightweight init process with support of initialization
(cont-init.d), finalization (cont-finish.d) as well as fixing ownership
permissions (fix-attrs.d). \* The s6-overlay provides proper PID 1
functionality inside docker container. Zombie processes will be properly
cleaned up. \* Support for multiple processes in a single container
("services") \* Usable with all base images - Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora \*
Distributed as a single .tar.gz file, to keep your image's number of
layers small. \* A whole set of utilities included in s6 and
s6-portable-utils. They include handy and composable utilities. \* Log
rotating out-of-the-box through logutil-service which uses s6-log under
the hood.

My\_Init
~~~~~~~~

Part of the Phusion baseimage project
https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker, which currently targets
Ubuntu 16:04, Ubuntu 14:04 OS-es. Consists of custom written py file and
wrapped optional runit.

Provides \* protection from software that accidentally creates zombie
processes - reaping is implemented as a part of control script. \* in
addition supports startup files in init.d and rc.local directories. \*
supports additional optional services inside container via runit: cron,
ssh \* handles additional magic with environment

Requires: python inside your container. In present form limited to
Ubuntu base system only.

Supervisord ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is known process manager usually used with python applications. I
often saw people trying to use it as init system. But: supervisor
explicitly mentions that it is not meant to be run as your init process.
If you have some subprocess fork itself off, it won’t be cleaned up by
Supervisor. Thus you anyway would need to choose different init system.

Good if you anyway used it with your application earlier.

More ?
~~~~~~

If you know more candidates, please comment.

Candidates for running multiple services inside container.
----------------------------------------------------------

From mentioned above and at the same time lightweight, worse to mention:

SupervisorD
~~~~~~~~~~~

Classic supervisor which does not even require root privileges. Ctl
script that acts similar to systemd's systemctl. Supports processes
restarting, as well as event handlers based on shell protocols.

RUnit
~~~~~

Runit ships with swiss-knife set of utilities, one of them is
``runsvdir`` (http://smarden.org/runit/runsvdir.8.html) It allows
defining set of "service definitions" in some directory, and makes care
on launching them at startup.

Typical interaction examples:

``/usr/bin/sv status /etc/service/`` - get status of services listed in
configuration folder

``/usr/bin/sv -w 10 down /etc/service/*`` - shutdown all services with
timeout 10

S6 (in scope of S6-overlay project)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike supervisor, s6 uses a folder structure to control services,
similar to RUnit. S6-overlay requires them under /etc/services.d before
running init (it then copies them over to /var/run/s6/services).

::

    services
        └ nginx
            └ run

Now, each of those run files is an executable that s6 executes to start
the process.

.. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    exec nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Services are controlled by s6-svc binary. It has number of options, but
the main idea is that you give it the directory of the service. So for
example, if I wanted to send SIGHUP to nginx, I would do s6-svc -h
/var/run/s6/services/nginx. Note: that it’s /var/run and not
/etc/services.d; This is hugh difference from RUnit. And lastly, the -h
is for SIGHUP.

s6-overlay comes with a number of built versions, so you can download
the one that matches your Linux setup. If you want to use s6 directly,
users of Alpine and a few other flavors of Linux can just install it
from their package manager. We’re running Debian and there’s no PPA for
it, so we would have to compile s6 on our own

More ?
~~~~~~

If you know more candidates, please comment.

Running processes as a different user
-------------------------------------

By default, Docker containers run as the root user. This is bad because:
\* Application might modify up things that it shouldn't be \* If
application shares folder with base host, all created files will be
owned by root \* If container is compromised - well, still it is bad if
they're root.

If you want to understand, how uid and gid work in Docker containers,
take a look on that article:
https://medium.com/@mccode/understanding-how-uid-and-gid-work-in-docker-containers-c37a01d01cf

What are the options:

Docker's native
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set on the level of Dockerfile

::

    # Create an app user so our program doesn't run as root.
    RUN groupadd -r app &&\
        useradd -r -g app -d /home/app -s /sbin/nologin -c "Docker image user" app
    ...
    USER app

or pass as the params on docker run

::

    docker run --rm --group-add audio --group-add nogroup --group-add 777 busybox id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=10(wheel),29(audio),99(nogroup),777

Success scenario, but not always possible, if container communicates
with the host.

chpst
~~~~~

This is utility which is shipped with RUnit
(http://smarden.org/runit/chpst.8.html) - you can easily use it if you
already have RUnit as part of your init system.

Phusion's setuser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| If you have chosen phusion image as a basis, you have a ``setuser`` in
  path
| https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/blob/master/image/bin/setuser

sudo
~~~~

Well, you can install sudo inside container. Some people do. But do you
want?

Your own baseimage built with ansible-container
===============================================

With information above you have already few ideas for constructing your
base image.

Sorry for repeating, but let me emphasize once more: if you want
alternative to custom makefiles and tons of hard-to-read shell files,
give a try to ansible-container. Ansible-container provides better
alternative to the ``command && command && command`` (and so on) syntax
you’ve been struggling with to build containers. Since Ansible is at the
heart of Ansible Container, you can make container builds completely
predictable and repeatable, and more over readable.

I have to admit, that although it is already passed 0.9.1,
ansible-container is still at it's early ages with some cumbersome side
effects from time to time
(https://medium.com/@V\_Voronenko/evaluating-ansible-container-as-a-tool-for-custom-docker-containers-build-500a0395a4c8),
but it really becomes more robust each minor release, thus if you try it
now - your production will be ready for concept when it is released...

Previously running ansible inside container required installing a lot of
unnecessary packages, which was causing bigger image sizes.
Ansible-cointainer introduced different approach: combination of
conductor (managing container with ansible and necessary tools
installed) and target container. This allows to keep target image size
small and this approach will work on any base image, which allows
ansible and python to be installed.

Aim of the current proof of concept: build bootstrap role for building
base application image, and thus simplify application play itself.

We want: select preferred init system: tini, dumb-init or init approach
by Phusion (phusion-init)

.. code:: yaml

    container_init: "phusion-init" # "dumb-init" "tini-init"
    container_init_directory: /etc/my_init.d

We want: have possibility to choose internal service layer: runit,
supervisor or s6.

.. code:: yaml

    container_svc: "runit" # "supervisord"

Following the Phusion's base image concept, we want optional cron, sshd,
and syslog services inside container.

.. code:: yaml

    option_container_cron: true
    option_container_sshd: true
    option_container_syslog_ng: true

If we ever wanted ssh inside container, let's provide keypair to trust.

.. code:: yaml

    container_ssh_private_key: "{{role_dir}}/files/keys/insecure_key"
    container_ssh_public_key: "{{role_dir}}/files/keys/insecure_key.pub"

Resulting play is compact and readable like your usual ansible play.

.. code:: yaml

      - include: tasks_system_services.yml

      - include: tasks_cron.yml
        when: option_container_cron

      - include: tasks_sshd.yml
        when: option_container_sshd

      - include: tasks_syslog_ng.yml
        when: option_container_syslog_ng

More over - we are not limited to some single approach - we are free to
select init system and service system from list of supported. You can
always add the new one.

In order to provide some compatibility between systems, I usually

a) put services runners into /etc/service//run - this supports both
   running via shell, runit, s6. Supervisord might re-execute the same
   script.
b) put image pre-initialization into /etc/myinit.d/\*.sh
c) always name entry point as docker-entrypoint.sh
d) your role, thanks to ansible, migth detect and target multiple
   basesystems - thus you can choose, for example, often used Alpine or
   Jessie.

Take a look on role example, that might be used to build such base
image: https://github.com/softasap/sa-container-bootstrap

Typical ansible-container play used to build application image using
your base play one might look as:

tini init system based, with supervisor as service manager

Summary
-------

Ansible-container, once it reaches stable version hopefully this year,
appears to be very promising tool for introducing complex docker based
build pipelines. In addition, ansible community allows you to re-use
number of available roles - that potentially can streamline your
deployment implementation path.
