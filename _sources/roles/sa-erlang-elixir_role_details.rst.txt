    <p>Installs erlang language (https://www.erlang.org/) and, optionally, elixir (http://elixir-lang.org/).</p>
    <p>Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language. It is also a garbage-collected runtime system. The sequential subset of Erlang supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing.</p>
    <p>Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.</p>
    <p>Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.</p>
    <p>Example of usage (all parameters are optional)</p>

    <li>What is the erlang package?
    Erlang/OTP Platform is a complex system composed of many smaller applications (modules). Installing the erlang package automatically installs the entire OTP suite. Since some of the more advanced users might want to download only a specific selection of modules, Erlang/OTP has been divided into smaller packages (all with the prefix erlang-) that can be installed without launching the erlang package.</li>
    <li>What is esl-erlang, how is it different from erlang? Have you removed it from repositories?
    The esl-erlang package is a file containg the complete installation: it includes the Erlang/OTP platform and all of its applications. The erlang package is a frontend to a number of smaller packages. Currently we support both erlang and esl-erlang.
    Note that the split packages have multiple advantages:
    seamless replacement of the available packages,
    other packages have dependencies on erlang, not esl-erlang,
    if your disk-space is low, you can get rid of some unused parts; erlang-base needs only ~13MB of space.</li>
