    <p>Supervisor: A Process Control System</p>
    <p>Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.</p>
    <p>It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools, and runit. Unlike some of these programs, it is not meant to be run as a substitute for init as “process id 1”. Instead it is meant to be used to control processes related to a project or a customer, and is meant to start like any other program at boot time.</p>
